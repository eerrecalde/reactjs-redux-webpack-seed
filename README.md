### Idea
I took the example done in Cory House's course https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter/ and added some extra features such as server side rendering.

### Key features
- Server side rendering (Dev and Prod)
- More real life example (compared to other starter kits) as it includes a fake API and all the data flow already working
- Redux
- Linting
- Unit Test (Mocha, Chai, Enzyme)
- It works with JS disabled

### First steps
- Clone the repository
- Run the following from the command line: `npm install`

#### Run Dev
- `npm start`

#### Run Prod
- `npm build:prod`
- `npm start:prod`
