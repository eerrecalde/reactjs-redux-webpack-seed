### First steps:
- Clone the repository
- Run the following from the command line: `npm install`
- You can directly run npm start
- Have a look at the "packages.json" file in the scripts node

#### Side Notes:
- There are a bunch of node modules that might not be used. This assumes all of them will be used at some point
